PDF-Table version 0.01
======================

This class is a utility for use with the PDF::API2 module from CPAN. 
It can be used to display text data in a table layout within the PDF. 
The text data must be in a 2d array (such as returned by a DBI 
statement handle fetchall_arrayref() call). The PDF::Table will 
automatically add as many new pages as necessary to display all of 
the data. Various layout properties, such as font, font size, and 
cell padding and background color can be specified for each column 
and/or for even/odd rows. See the perldoc after installation.
